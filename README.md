# epiMetOncoFit: Predicting the important epigenetic contributors to cancer using metabolic and epigenomic data

### Need to do:
- [ ] Add proteomics to eMetOncoFit
- [ ] Figure out how to label what genes are methylated or not methylated
	- [ ] Run eMetOncoFit
- [ ] Think about other features/properties that will be important for epigenetic modifications
- [ ] Read papers
- [ ] Hi-C
- [ ] Overall charge of protein sequence
- [ ] Distance towards protein methylation and acetylation
- [ ] Structural metrics?

### Hypotheses to test for this paper:
- [ ] Correlation between patient survival and epigenetic status
- [ ] Correlation between metabolic status and epigenetic states
- [ ] Epigenomic variability leads are strong features for predicting personalized health
