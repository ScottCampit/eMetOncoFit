# MetOncoFit
#### A Machine Learning Algorithm to Identify Common Biochemical and Topological Attributes of Metabolic Genes Recurrently Dysregulated in Tumors
 MetOncoFit is a data-driven approach that uses biochemical and metabolic attributes to predict tumor differential expression, copy number variation, and patient survival.

#### Installation
MetOncoFit is a Python package that takes curated cancer metabolic models to output differential expression, copy number variation, and patient survival classification predictions and ranked metabolic/biochemical feature importances.

We recommend installing MetOncoFit inside a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/). To install the package, use PyPI:

``` Python
pip install metoncofit
```

Visit the documentation to start using MetOncoFit and explore the API. Feel free to submit bugs, feature requests, and Pull requests.
