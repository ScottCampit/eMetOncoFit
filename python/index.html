<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>MetOncoFit is a Python package that takes curated cancer metabolic models to output differential expression, copy number variation, and patient survival classification predictions and ranked metabolic/biochemical feature importances.</p>
<p>We recommend installing MetOncoFit inside a <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">virtual environment</a>. To install the package, use PyPI:</p>
<p><code>Python
pip install metoncofit</code></p>
